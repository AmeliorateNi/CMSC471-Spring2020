    "We've studied two types of search algorithms during the recent lectures: Uninformed Search and Informed Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformed Search (aka blind search) refers to the search strategies that do not use additional information about states and goal of the search - nothing beyond the provided problem definition. The first algorithms that we studied from Chapter 3 of the Russel & Norvig textbook were Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) which both fall into the category of Uniformed Search.  In the first part of this assignment, you will implement both BFS and DFS algorithms in Python and then test them on a simple graph and grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also studied how we can modify DFS to combine the advantages of BFS (completeness and conditional optimality) with the main advantage of DFS --space complexity of $O(bm)$ where $b$ is the branching factor and $m$ is the maximum depth of the search space. Limited Depth Search and Iterative Deepening DFS were two algorithms that we studied in that section and you are going to implement them in Part II of this assignment and you will test them on 8-puzzle problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Part III, you will work on a graph by applying Informed Search algorithms: Greedy Best-First Search and A*. As discussed in the lectures, informed search algorithms use heuristic functions. You'll also check and prove whether the provided heuristic is admissible and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Very Important Note:</b> Read ALL the instructions in this notebook very carefully. Careless reading and skipping lines would be a major source of making mistakes and losing points in your first assignment! Also notice that this assignment has three parts and requires a lot of work. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse to delay your submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pedagogically, this assignment will help you:\n",
    "- better understand how these algorithms work in pratice. \n",
    "- brush up your Python skills - and possibly learn a couple of new \"Pythonic\" tricks!\n",
    "- pratice reading documentation. This is a very important skill in AI/ML/Data Science collaborative environments and teams.\n",

    "  * `depthFirstSearch(startState, goalState, successorsf)`\n",

    "Each receives as arguments the starting state, the goal state, and a successors function.  `breadthFirstSearch` returns the breadth-first solution path as a list of states starting with the `startState` and ending with the `goalState`.  `depthFirstSearch` returns the depth-first solution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference between BFS and DFS is the order they visit/expand and goal-test the nodes. They use a different mechanism for storing the nodes in memory. As discussed in the lectures, sections 3.3.1, 3.4.1 and Figure 3.11 of the textbook, BFS uses a FIFO strategy with a queue data structure and DFS uses a LIFO strategy with a stack data structure to pop the unexpanded nodes. Both FIFO and LIFO can be easily implemented in Python with a similar \"list\" data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you implemented the required fucntions, demonstrate each one running correctly with a simple graph as shown in the following example, and with the grid example.  Test your code on other graphs.

    "The `takeActionF_8p` wrapper function below takes the action given on the input state for an 8-puzzle and returns the new state that the puzzle transitions to. It calls the takeActionF_Puzzle helper function. It was also designed to accommodate different sized puzzles. The `takeActionF_Puzzle` function begins by making a copy of the given state. The [`copy`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/copy.html) was needed so as not to modify the state that was passed in by reference. The function iterates through the rows and columns and locates the blank. When the blank is found, it performs the given action by \"moving\" the blank to the specified direction. It does this by swapping the values in the state list. Then the resulting new state is returned."

It combines the benefits of DFS (lower space complexity) with the benefits of BFS (completeness and conditional optimality). It gradually increases the depth limit until the goal is found and returns the solution path. It takes in as arguments the start state, goal state, actions functions, and the max depth. It cycles through the depths and runs a depth limited search using the parameters. If the goal is found, the solution path is returned. We also insert the start state for completeness. If the goal is not found, then the depth limit is increased by one iteratively until either the goal is found or a failure is returned. And a cutoff is returned if we reach the max depth without reaching the goal - you can set the max threshold to avoid long runtimes."

For example, in the simple example below, switching the position of 1 and 2 makes it impossible to reach the goal state. It would seem that this could be done with a few simple slides, but our test below with iterative deepening set at max depth of 10 still cannot find a solution. In general, an odd number of inversions ([inverted number positions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-instance-8-puzzle-solvable/)) from the starting state in comparision to the goal state leads to an unsolvable puzzle."
